# **CPSC 304 Project**
The following project is full stack application that models an auction system that would be used by an auction company. 

## Project Overview
### Auction Database Management System

â€¢ Our project is an auction system that allows users from the auction company side to make changes and/or update databases containing information regarding auction sessions, auctioneers, items, delivery vehicles, storage facilities, appraisers, and customers. The database tracks the logistics of moving auctioned items from storage to auction houses as well as the status of items including the bids they have and condition. The database also provides a mechanism for sale and auction management and customer transactions, where the company can review who has bought an item or sold an item. The user can review the items to be sold along with their current selling status, enhancing efficiency and transparency in the auction process.
